In the extrusion-based 3D printing method of cementitious materials, one of the technical challenges is
about buildability; when deposited fresh mortar is not stiff enough, significant deformation or even
collapse of the printed object occurs during printing. There have been several previous studies on
prediction and evaluation of the buildability for a given cementitious material.

When conducting printing experiment, the authors found an interesting failure mode of a printed object; well-distributed shear
bands initiated and propagated on the object surface. This type of failure has not yet been reported in
previous studies, which is the motivation of the present study. To investigate the failure mode and its
mechanism, square-tube objects made of either limestone powder paste or cement mortar were printed
by using a small-scale gantry-type 3D mortar printer. Digital images of the object surface were taken
during printing and the initiation and propagation of shear bands were observed. In addition, the surface
strain/deformation of the printed object was analyzed by using two-dimensional Digital Image
Correlation (DIC) technique.

The experimental results demonstrated that multiple shear bands could
appear on the object surface during printing, followed by a “landslide” occurring along the shear band,
which resulted in significant vertical and radial deformation of the printed object. In addition, the DIC
analysis revealed that diagonal bands with relatively high strain levels can be observed in the strain maps
before the shear band becomes visible to the naked eye. Moreover, the appearance of the shear bands
precedes the remarkable vertical deformation of the printed object. This suggests that a live monitoring
system to detect the imminent collapse of a fresh printed object would be possible; by taking images of
the object surface and analyzing them by DIC during printing, the system can give an alert of the risk of
object collapse.
